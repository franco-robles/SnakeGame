# Snake Game 

## Overview
A simple snake game using Swing to display the game. I've used many clean code practices to improve readability and future enhancements. I've also commented all functions as part of good practice.
I like to make simple programs and then polish them by adding new functionalities, good programming practices, and also in this case colors, shapes, music, bug fixing.
